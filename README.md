Github Shortcut Buttons is a browser extension making it easier to access your profile, starred repos & more from your dashboard, via an injected mini-profile segment.

Published on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-shortcut-buttons/pjpbnpfnlneikmbimeppahghpgeogfka) and [Firefox Addon Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/github-shortcut-buttons/).

### How?
By taking some values from the website, injecting some HTML into it, and fetching the others from the API.

### Fetching? What about the rate limit, then?

It's a rate limit of 60 per hour, but the results seem to be cache-able, so you probably won't spam it enough to find this warning.
